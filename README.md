feature-sliced is a structural pattern for frontend projects that aims logic separation of components and library code. The main idea is to split code to logical pieces grouped by business entities called features.

### Versions

Now feature-sliced has **two** versions:
- [v0.1 — First public version](/v0.1.md), tested in 20+ applications
- [v1.0 — Next version](/v1.0.md), work in progress
